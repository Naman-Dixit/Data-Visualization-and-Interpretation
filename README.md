Specialization subject studied in sem 5 year 3, batch 7, Data science
#
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and applying data visualization and interpretation techniques. It contains projects, code examples, and guides using popular tools like Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, Pandas), Power BI, and Tableau.

# Why Data Visualization?
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

# Getting Started
Python

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name.git

Navigate to the python/ directory.

Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter

Launch a Jupyter Notebook to explore the examples:

jupyter notebook

# Power BI & Tableau
Simply open the .pbix or .twb/.twbx files with their respective software. The datasets used in these projects are also included within their respective folders.

# Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you have a project, an interesting visualization, or a new technique you'd like to share, feel free to open a pull request. Please ensure your code is well-commented and your projects are clearly documented.
